# Various Schematics and Utilities for the Centurion Minicomputer

Schematics are reverse engineered from multiple hi-res images of the various cards.

#### IMPORTANT: Schematics are WIP and may contain mistakes or errors.

## Utilities
Useful python3 scripts for investigating disk images

- arcscan.py - scan a raw disk image in the backup format.
- fsscan.py - scan a raw disk image with live file system.
- binstrip.py - clears the MSB of every octet in a file, to make searching for strings easier (outputs to a separate file)
